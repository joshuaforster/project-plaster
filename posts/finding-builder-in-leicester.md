Choosing a builder is a big decision. Get it right, and your renovation runs smoothly. Get it wrong, and you can end up with delays, stress and costs spiralling out of control.  

Here are five things many homeowners forget to check — and how Lambert & Wright ticks every box.

## 1. Proven Work You Can Actually See

A professional website and a business card are one thing, but nothing beats seeing the work for yourself.  

We always encourage prospective clients to:  

- Browse our **online gallery** of past projects  
- Check out our **case studies** to see how we manage full transformations  
- Visit a previous job if they’d like to see our workmanship up close  

From 1920s semis to full countryside renovations in Rutland, we’ve got a track record that speaks for itself.

## 2. Insurance and Accreditation

A surprising number of homeowners never ask their builder about insurance. Yet if something goes wrong and your builder isn’t covered, the risk can land squarely on you.  

At Lambert & Wright, we carry **full public liability insurance** and comply with all local regulations. Our **LABC award for Best Renovation Company in the East Midlands** also reflects that we meet the highest standards of safety and compliance.

## 3. Project Management, Not Just Building

This is where most self-managed projects come unstuck.  

A builder can do the brickwork. But who’s making sure the electrician and plasterer don’t overlap? Who’s confirming the kitchen delivery arrives at the right stage? Who’s talking to building control?  

That’s where we come in. We **don’t just build** — we **coordinate every moving part**. From arranging trades to handling paperwork, we take the stress off your shoulders. Clients deal with **one point of contact**, and we handle the chaos behind the scenes.

## 4. Clear and Consistent Communication

A renovation can run for weeks or months. If you’re left in the dark, even the smallest hiccup feels like a disaster.  

We keep things transparent. Clients receive **regular updates**, know exactly where the project stands, and always have someone they can reach for answers. It’s one of the reasons we’ve built long-term trust in Leicester, Rutland and across the East Midlands.

## 5. Local Knowledge and Experience

Local knowledge saves time and money. We’ve been working in South Leicestershire and Rutland for over **30 years**, which means we:  

- Know the local planning quirks and building inspectors  
- Have relationships with trusted suppliers and tradespeople  
- Can spot potential problems that less experienced or out-of-town builders might miss
