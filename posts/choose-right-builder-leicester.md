When you’re planning building work on your home, the first and most important step is choosing the right builder. A good builder will make your project smooth and stress-free, while the wrong choice can lead to delays, hidden costs, and endless frustration.  

If you’re looking for builders in Leicester, here are some key points to consider before you commit.  

---

## 1. Look for Local Knowledge

Builders based in Leicester understand the local housing styles, planning rules, and suppliers. This saves you time and money because they know how to get things done quickly and correctly. Using a local builder also means they can visit your property easily and keep a close eye on progress.

## 2. Check Experience and Reviews

Don’t be afraid to ask for examples of previous work. A good builder should be able to show you photos of completed projects and share customer feedback. Online reviews are a good starting point, but it’s even better if you can speak to past clients directly.

## 3. Ask the Right Questions

Before you sign anything, ask questions such as:  

- How long will the job take?  
- What trades are included in the price (plumbing, electrics, etc.)?  
- Do you handle planning permission if needed?  

Clear answers upfront help you avoid nasty surprises later on.

## 4. Beware of Red Flags

Extremely cheap quotes, vague answers, or pressure to pay upfront in full are signs to be cautious. A reliable builder will give you a clear breakdown of costs and agree a sensible payment schedule.

## 5. Choose a Full-Service Team

One of the biggest headaches in building work is trying to organise multiple trades yourself. A builder might finish their job, but if the plumber or electrician isn’t ready, everything grinds to a halt.  

That’s why using a full-service team like Lambert & Wright makes sense. We provide not just builders in Leicester, but also plumbing, electrics, landscaping, and more. You don’t have to juggle different people or chase contractors. Everything is managed under one roof, giving you peace of mind that the job will be finished properly.
