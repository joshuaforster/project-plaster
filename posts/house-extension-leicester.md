A house extension is one of the best ways to add space and value to your home without the hassle of moving. Whether it is a bigger kitchen, an extra bedroom, or a garden room, an extension can completely change how you live.  

Before you dive in, there are some key things to know if you are planning a house extension in Leicester.  

---

## Do You Need Planning Permission?

Not every extension needs full planning permission. Some projects fall under permitted development, especially smaller rear extensions. Larger builds, double storey extensions, or anything facing the street usually require approval.  

It is always best to check with Leicester City Council before starting. Lambert & Wright can guide you through this process to make sure everything is compliant.

## Typical Costs for Extensions

In Leicester, the cost of a house extension usually starts from around £1,500–£2,500 per square metre. The final figure depends on factors such as:  

- The size and layout of your extension  
- Whether it is single or double storey  
- The level of finishes you want, from basic to high-end  
- Access to your property, such as narrow driveways or sloping gardens

## How Long Does It Take?

A straightforward single storey extension can often be completed within 8–12 weeks. More complex designs, double storey extensions, or projects with tricky access may take longer. Having all trades under one roof helps keep things on schedule.

## Do Not Forget the Foundations

Solid foundations are essential. At Lambert & Wright we also offer ground screw foundations, a modern, eco-friendly alternative to concrete. Ground screws can be installed quickly with minimal disruption, meaning your build gets started faster and with less environmental impact.

## Why Use a Full-Service Team?

One of the biggest challenges of a house extension is managing all the different trades. You will often need:  

- Builders  
- Plumbers  
- Electricians  
- Roofers  
- Landscapers  

Trying to coordinate them all yourself is stressful and can lead to delays. With Lambert & Wright, everything is handled in-house. Our team covers all trades, meaning the project flows smoothly from start to finish.
