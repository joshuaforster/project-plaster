In 2023 we were named Best Renovation Company in the East Midlands by the LABC (Local Authority Building Control). This is something today, we are still proud of. 

## What the LABC Award Represents

The LABC is responsible for making sure building projects meet national standards for safety, quality, and compliance. Their awards recognise companies who go above and beyond to deliver work that not only looks great, but is structurally sound, energy efficient, and built to last.

That’s what we do.

Our projects have always been about more than aesthetics. We care about the pipework behind the walls. The insulation under the floor. The way the build will hold up ten, fifteen, twenty years from now.

Winning this award means our values have been recognised by the very people who regulate our industry. And we don’t take that lightly.

## Why It Matters for Homeowners

Renovating a property isn’t easy. There are hundreds of moving parts, from planning permissions and regulations to managing trades and deliveries. For most homeowners, it’s easy to feel out of your depth.

That’s where we come in.

Our job isn’t just to build. It’s to manage the whole process from start to finish, so you’re not the one chasing electricians, calling plasterers, or wondering when the kitchen is due to arrive.

The award validates how we work. But more importantly, it tells future clients they can trust us to deliver a high standard, communicate clearly and take their project seriously.

## Built on Trust

We didn’t win this alone. It’s down to the homeowners who trusted us with their homes. And the skilled tradespeople, designers and suppliers who work alongside us every day.

Whether we’re transforming a 1920s semi or building a brand-new extension, our approach doesn’t change. We stay hands on. We keep things transparent. We treat every job as if it were our own home.
