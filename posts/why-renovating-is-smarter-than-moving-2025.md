# Why Renovating Is Smarter Than Moving (In 2025)

Thinking of upgrading your home, but torn between renovating or moving?

With property prices, legal fees and mortgage rates climbing, more homeowners than ever are choosing to stay put and reimagine the space they already have.

Here’s why renovation might be the smarter move — and how we can help you make it work.

## The True Cost of Moving

Moving house isn’t just about the new property price. Here’s what else gets added on:

- **Estate agent fees** (1–3%)  
- **Stamp duty** (thousands)  
- **Solicitor fees**  
- **Survey & removal costs**  
- **Mortgage exit/setup fees**

Even on a £400K property, you can easily spend **£25,000–£35,000** just to move.

## Renovation: A Better Use of That Budget?

What if you put that same £25–35K into your current home instead?

- Add a kitchen extension  
- Create a loft bedroom  
- Modernise your bathrooms  
- Open up your living space  

With clever planning, many of our clients add value to their property while also improving their lifestyle.

## Why Homeowners Regret Moving

We’ve had clients say:

> “We thought moving would be simpler, but all we needed was better space planning.”

Renovation lets you stay in the area you love, avoid the stress of school moves, commutes, and mortgage upheaval — while still creating your dream space.
