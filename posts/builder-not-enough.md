Hiring a builder is essential. But if you stop there, your renovation could still become one of the most stressful experiences of your life.  

Here’s why relying on a builder alone isn’t enough — and how we solve the gaps.

## The Reality of Renovation Projects

Even a simple home extension involves:  

- Multiple trades (builders, electricians, plumbers, decorators)  
- Materials and deliveries arriving in the correct order  
- Local regulations, inspections and approvals  
- Unexpected challenges like hidden structural issues  

If nobody is managing all these moving parts, small problems snowball into big delays and extra costs.

## Why Builders Alone Can’t Cover Everything

Most builders focus on their trade. They’ll do the brickwork or the carpentry, but they **won’t be chasing the kitchen supplier**, calling the plumber, or checking that the skip gets swapped out on time.  

This gap is why many homeowners:  

- Blow their budget with overlapping trades  
- Face long delays waiting for missing materials  
- End up firefighting instead of enjoying the process
