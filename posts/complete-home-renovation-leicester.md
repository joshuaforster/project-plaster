Home renovation projects are exciting, but they can quickly turn stressful when you are trying to manage multiple trades on your own. You might need a builder, an electrician, a plumber, a roofer, and a landscaper, all at different times and all with different schedules.  

If even one person is delayed, the whole project grinds to a halt. That is why more homeowners in Leicester are choosing full service renovation teams like Lambert & Wright.

## The Problem With Sourcing Trades Separately

On paper, hiring separate trades can look cheaper. In reality, it often creates problems such as:  

- Delays when one trade is not ready on time  
- Miscommunication between contractors  
- Inconsistent standards of work  
- Unexpected extra costs if something gets missed  

Instead of running smoothly, your renovation can feel like a never ending juggling act.

## The Benefits of a Full Service Team

With a complete home renovation service, everything is managed under one roof. That means:  

- One point of contact, so you are not chasing five different contractors  
- Consistent quality, with every part of the job held to the same high standard  
- Better scheduling, as the team works together to keep the project on track
